<h2> Small Descreption: </h2> 
        <p> I grew up in St-Leonard and haven't move since birth. First sport my dad introduced to me was hockey. I played Hockey for a few years, then my dad realized that I only had a sport to play during the winter and not in the summer, so my dad intruduced me to baseball (because he's a mega baseball fan) and once again I was attached. I attended a french elementary school in Montreal-Nord but due to the amount if italians attending the school I made friends quickly and barly sopke french while at the school.
